# Watchtower — one pane for every standalone watcher

Ragnar ships a family of deep, continuous passive monitors that each run as their
own daemon: [`arp_guard`](arp_guard.md), [`ndpwatch`](ndpwatch.md),
[`wifiwatch`](wifiwatch.md), [`certwatch`](certwatch.md),
[`snmpwatch`](snmpwatch.md), [`isiswatch`](isiswatch.md) and
[`igmpwatch`](igmpwatch.md). They are the suite's sharpest detectors — but each
wrote to its own log with its own schema, so there was **no single place to see
them and no single notification path.** Watchtower is that place.

`watchtower.py` **tails every watcher's JSON-lines log, normalizes the records
into one common shape, and shows them in one deduped feed** — in the web UI
(Diagnostics → *Watchtower*) and, for new high/critical findings, through one
Pushover path. It is **read-only over the log files**: it never captures a
packet or sends one. The watchers stay the sensors; Watchtower is the aggregator.

## Why one normalizer, not seven adapters

The watchers disagree on nearly every field, so Watchtower uses a single
key-aware normalizer rather than a brittle adapter per tool:

| Field | Where watchers put it |
|---|---|
| severity | `severity` (`critical`/`high`/…), `status` (`CRIT`/`WARN`/`INFO`/`OK`), or `sev` (`INFO`/`LOW`/`MED`/`HIGH`) |
| timestamp | epoch float **or** ISO-8601 string |
| finding id | `codes[]`, `code`, `detector`, `rule`, or `findings[].code` |
| endpoints | `src`/`sender_ip`/`server_ip`/`identity`/`system`, `target`/`dst`/`group` |

`normalize()` searches a priority-ordered set of keys for each field. The upshot:
**a new watcher that emits JSON lines with any recognisable severity field shows
up with zero code changes.** Records that aren't alerts — an `OK`/`clean` status,
certwatch inventory noise — normalize to *no severity* and are dropped.

Alerts land on a canonical severity ladder: `critical > high > medium > low >
info`. `WARN`/`warning` maps to `medium`; an unrecognised-but-present severity
surfaces as `medium` rather than being dropped.

## Enabling it

**On by default** — unlike the Network Integrity Monitor, Watchtower makes no
outbound calls and captures nothing; it only reads log files the watchers already
write, and is a no-op until a watcher is actually running. Toggle it in
**Diagnostics → Watchtower**, or:

```json
"watchtower_enabled": false
```

A background poller reads the delta from each watcher log every
`watchtower_interval_s` seconds, updates the panes, and pages new findings at or
above `watchtower_notify_min_severity`.

> **Config changes need a service restart** to take effect — the running process
> holds the config and the routes in memory (`sudo systemctl restart ragnar`).

### Config keys

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `watchtower_enabled` | `true` | master switch for the aggregator + poller |
| `watchtower_interval_s` | `30` | poll cadence (min 5s) |
| `watchtower_max_alerts` | `500` | size of the rolling in-memory/persisted ring |
| `watchtower_notify_enabled` | `true` | send Pushover for new findings |
| `watchtower_notify_min_severity` | `high` | floor for paging (`critical`/`high`/`medium`/`low`) |
| `watchtower_notify_cooldown_s` | `300` | min seconds between Pushover sends (burst backstop) |
| `watchtower_realert_hours` | `0` | re-page a still-standing finding after N hours (`0` = page once) |
| `watchtower_dirs` | *(unset)* | override the watched log directories (list) |

**No re-paging on restart:** on first sight of a log file Watchtower skips to its
end (`tail -f` semantics), so a service restart never replays — and re-pages —
the backlog. Rotation and truncation are detected (inode + size) and re-read from
the top. Per-finding dedup memory persists to `data/watchtower_seen.json`; the
display ring persists to `data/watchtower_alerts.json` so the pane isn't blank
after a restart.

## Making every watcher visible: the common log dir

Watchtower reads two things: each watcher's known default log path **and** every
`*.jsonl` file in `/var/log/ragnar/`. The recommended setup — and the "drop a
file in and it appears" path — is to point each watcher at
`/var/log/ragnar/<tool>.jsonl`.

**Streaming today (appear with no change):**

- **ndpwatch** → `/var/log/ndpwatch/alerts.jsonl` (its unit already writes JSONL)
- **wifiwatch** → `/var/lib/ragnar/wifiwatch/events.jsonl` (already JSONL)

**Need a one-line change to stream JSON-lines to a file:**

```ini
# common dir, once
sudo mkdir -p /var/log/ragnar

# arp_guard / ndpwatch / wifiwatch: add/point --jsonl at the common dir
ExecStart=… python3 python/arp_guard.py -i eth0 --jsonl /var/log/ragnar/arp_guard.jsonl

# certwatch logs --json to stdout (journald); stream it to a file instead:
StandardOutput=append:/var/log/ragnar/certwatch.jsonl

# igmpwatch: set its alert sink to /var/log/ragnar/igmpwatch.jsonl in igmpwatch.yaml
```

**Not line-delimited yet:** `snmpwatch --json` and `isiswatch --web-json` write a
*snapshot/at-exit report*, not a per-alert stream, so they won't feed a live tail
until pointed at a JSON-lines sink. Until then they're absent from the pane (shown
as `○` in the source line) rather than silently wrong.

The Watchtower card shows a source line — `● ARP Guard  ○ Cert Watch …` — so you
can see at a glance which watchers are actually logging where Watchtower can read
them (`●` present, `○` no log found / not running).

## The panes

**Dashboard** — a Watchtower card sits under the stats grid on the landing tab:
severity chips (or a green *All clear*), the five newest findings, and a
`3/7 watchers logging: ● ARP Guard ○ Cert Watch …` source line. It refreshes with
the dashboard (on open, then every 20s), so an active attack is visible without
digging.

**Diagnostics → Watchtower** — the full pane: severity-count chips, newest-alert
time, per-source presence, and a newest-first alert list (source · title · codes ·
endpoints · time). A severity filter (`all` … `critical`) narrows both the list
and what the API returns.

API: `GET /api/net/watchtower?limit=100&min_severity=high` →
`{success, enabled, summary, alerts[]}`.

## Self-test

```bash
python3 watchtower.py --self-test        # 31/31 — no root, no daemons, no wire
```

The harness drives real ndpwatch/arp_guard/wifiwatch/certwatch/igmpwatch/snmpwatch
record shapes through the normalizer (severity/status/sev vocabularies, epoch vs
ISO timestamps, the `findings[]`/`rule`/`detector` id variants, OK-is-not-an-alert)
and exercises the tailer end-to-end over real files: incremental deltas, a
partial line held until its newline, truncation/rotation re-reads, and the
`tail_only` backlog-skip.

Debug from the CLI without the web app:

```bash
python3 watchtower.py --dir /var/log/ragnar --once            # dump current alerts
python3 watchtower.py --dir /var/log/ragnar --follow --min-severity high
```

## Correlation

The same normalized stream feeds the [incident correlation
engine](incident-correlation.md), which fuses related alerts into named
attack-chain *incidents* (e.g. an evil-twin beacon + a deauth + a captured
handshake, all sharing one BSSID, become one "Evil-twin WPA handshake capture").
Incidents lead both the dashboard card and the Diagnostics pane, above the raw
alert feed.

## Limitations

- **Same vantage as its sensors.** Watchtower only sees what the watchers see;
  place each watcher on the segment / SPAN it needs (see each tool's doc).
- **A watcher must be running and logging to a file** Watchtower can read. It does
  not start the watchers; it aggregates their output.
- **snapshot-only outputs** (`snmpwatch`, `isiswatch` as shipped) need a JSON-lines
  sink before they stream into the pane — see the common-dir section above.
