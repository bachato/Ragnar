# Wardriving Diagnostics Panel

A deep, read-only diagnostics view for the wardriving stack. It answers the
field questions the plain status card cannot — *why is only one radio scanning?
what is each dongle drawing? is the Pi browning out? is the GPS actually alive
or just showing stale numbers?* — and draws a live **GPS sky view**.

- **UI:** bottom of the **Wardriving** tab, and of the phone-access AP page
  (`web/wardrive_mobile.html`). A native `<details>` element, collapsed by
  default.
- **Backend:** [`wardrive_diagnostics.py`](../wardrive_diagnostics.py)
- **Endpoint:** `GET /api/wardriving/diagnostics`

## Why a separate endpoint

The 3-second wardriving status poll stays cheap. This payload walks sysfs and
shells out to `iw` / `vcgencmd`, so it is fetched **only while the panel is
expanded** (at most every 8 s on the client; the backend caches the whole
payload for 5 s). Collapse the panel and the extra work stops.

Everything here is **best-effort and read-only**: a missing tool or sysfs node
degrades a single field, never the whole payload. Each top-level section is
wrapped so one failure (e.g. `power_error`) can't take the others down.

The panel is a `<details>` element on purpose — the toggle keeps working even
when a script errors, which is precisely when you reach for diagnostics. Its
summary always shows a live hint (`GPS fix` / `GPS searching` / `no GPS`, with
`· error` appended when the engine or GPS reports one), so a glance is often
enough without expanding.

## Groups

The **GPS**, **Session**, **Scanning**, **Coverage**, **Companions** and
**Device** groups come from the status object the panel already polls. The
**GPS constellations**, **GPS sky view**, **Radios**, **Power** and **Errors**
groups come from this endpoint.

| Group | Contents |
|-------|----------|
| **GPS** | fix + quality, satellites used/in-view, SNR max, HDOP, lat/lon/altitude, speed, course, source, port, age of last update and last NMEA sentence, time-to-first-fix (or how long it has been searching), error |
| **GPS constellations** | per-constellation satellites in view and peak SNR (GPS / GLONASS / Galileo / BeiDou / QZSS / NavIC) |
| **GPS sky view** | polar plot of every satellite by azimuth/elevation, coloured per constellation — North up, zenith at centre, horizon at the rim. Fill opacity tracks SNR (untracked satellites render hollow); hover a dot for PRN / elevation / azimuth / SNR. The graphical half of the same GSV data u-center draws. A **⛶ Fullscreen** button opens an immersive view with a real **starfield** behind the satellites (see below) |
| **Radios** | every wireless interface present, whether it is scanning, its driver / mode / link state, the USB adapter behind it — and **when it is not scanning, the reason** |
| **Power** | per-USB-device declared draw and which interface it backs, summed USB budget, `usb_max_current_enable`, supply throttle/under-voltage flags (now and since boot), core voltage, temperature, and Pi 5 PMIC board power |
| **Errors** | everything currently complaining — engine, GPS, radios, companions, supply and **stalled feeds** — gathered into one list |

## Radios — "why is only wlan0 scanning?"

`radios()` enumerates **every** wireless netdev from sysfs (the authority on
what exists), then for each one reports whether it is in the live scan set and,
if not, **why** — ordered by how decisive the cause is:

1. `monitor child interface (skipped by design)` — a `*mon` / `mon*` vif
2. `rfkill-blocked — run: sudo rfkill unblock all`
3. `held as the uplink / management radio`
4. `in AP mode (lent to the phone-access AP)`
5. `lent to the phone-access AP`
6. `not claimed — present but not in the scan set`

Each row also carries `mode` (managed/monitor/AP via `iw`), `operstate`,
`driver`, and the backing USB device (product / manufacturer / USB id /
declared mA) when the radio is a dongle.

> New BT/WiFi dongles come up **rfkill-blocked** system-wide until
> `sudo rfkill unblock all` — the Radios group names this explicitly so it isn't
> mistaken for a driver fault.

## Power — USB budget + supply health

`power()` reports the per-USB-device **declared** draw (`bMaxPower` from the USB
descriptor — *declared, not measured*; no Pi meters per-port current), which
netdev each adapter backs, and the summed budget. Plus supply health from
`vcgencmd`:

- **`get_throttled` flags**, split into **now** (low nibble) and **since boot**
  (bits 16–19). The "occurred" bits are the ones that catch a brownout that
  already passed — exactly the case where a GPS cold start dies but everything
  looks healthy by the time you go looking.
- **Core voltage** and **temperature**.
- **`usb_max_current_enable`** and **Pi 5 PMIC rail power**, reported **only on
  a Pi 5** (the flag is meaningless on a Pi 4 / Zero 2 W, so the row is omitted
  there rather than shown as a false problem). On a Pi 5 total USB peripheral
  current is capped at 600 mA unless a 5 A PD supply is detected or this flag is
  set.

## Errors — one list, with feed-stall correlation

`errors()` gathers engine / GPS / companion / power complaints into one list,
and adds the two failure modes the summary numbers hide:

- **Stale GPS** — the receiver still reports `connected`, but no NMEA sentence
  has arrived for **> 30 s** (`GPS_STALE_S`). A stopped feed looks identical to
  a weak one in the numbers — the count and SNR just sit at their last value —
  so this is called out explicitly.
- **Stalled scan** — the engine reports `running`, but no scan completed for
  **> 60 s** (`SCAN_STALE_S`).
- **Shared-USB correlation** — if **both** feeds go quiet within a minute of
  each other, that points at the shared USB bus (a hub dropping, a bus/power
  dip) rather than at reception or either device individually. The hint says so
  and points you at `dmesg` for USB resets/disconnects.

> **Reading a stale panel.** If you see `Last NMEA` tens of minutes old while
> `Satellites`/`SNR` still show non-zero values, those numbers are **frozen** —
> the feed died and the last sample is just being held. The **GPS sky view will
> be empty** (its per-satellite data is pruned after 30 s of staleness), even
> though the constellation counts may still show a stale figure.

## GPS sky view & the data behind it

The sky view is driven by NMEA **`GSV` ("satellites in view")** sentences,
which a receiver emits *while still searching* — so dots appear **before** a
position fix, as soon as the antenna is hearing satellites. See the **GPS**
section of the [Wardriving Guide](wardriving.md#gps) for the parsing details:
the multi-message GSV sweep is stitched into a per-satellite list (PRN,
elevation, azimuth, SNR) per constellation, exposed here as `gps.sky`.

Each dot needs **both** azimuth and elevation, which the receiver can only
compute once it has the satellite's almanac. On a full cold start there is a
window where the constellation counts show satellites (SNR only) but the sky
plot is still empty — the dots fill in once the almanac downloads, typically
still before the fix completes. u-blox 7 pucks lose their almanac every power
cycle, so this cold-start window is expected on that hardware, not a bug.

**gpsd vs direct NMEA.** When a `gpsd` instance owns the receiver, Ragnar reads
its JSON stream (`TPV`/`SKY`) instead of raw NMEA. The satellite counts, used
count and SNR come from gpsd `SKY` reports along that path.

### Fullscreen sky view (stars behind the satellites)

The **⛶ Fullscreen** button on the sky view opens
[`web/scripts/skyview.js`](../web/scripts/skyview.js) — a full-window overlay
(Esc or ✕ to close) that draws a **real starfield** behind the live satellites,
so you can see the sky the receiver is looking at.

- **Stars** come from a bundled bright-star catalog
  ([`web/vendor/star_catalog.json`](../web/vendor/star_catalog.json) — 1,627
  stars to magnitude 5, RA/Dec J2000, colour-bucketed by B–V; derived from the
  d3-celestial / HYG–Hipparcos data, BSD-2-Clause). Each star's RA/Dec is
  projected to the observer's local **altitude/azimuth** from the GPS fix and
  the device clock using standard sidereal-time math, so stars and satellites
  share one true-north frame. Star size scales with brightness; the brightest
  named stars are labelled.
- **Stars render only with a live GPS fix** — without lat/lon we cannot place
  them. No fix ⇒ the overlay shows satellites only, with a note. (Satellites,
  which carry their own az/el, always render.)
- **Tap/click** a satellite for its constellation / PRN / elevation / azimuth /
  SNR, or a star for its name, constellation, magnitude and elevation/azimuth.
- It polls this same endpoint every ~2.5 s, so satellites move live and the
  starfield drifts with sidereal time.

No external libraries or CDN — pure SVG + vanilla JS; the RA/Dec→alt/az
transform is self-tested against Polaris (altitude ≈ latitude, azimuth ≈ 0°).
